# FT54X6
 FT54X6 7inch Touch Panel library for Arduino and STM32

This library is for FT54X6 7 inch Touchscreens. Tested with ASUS ZENFONE MAX ZC550KL that has FT5446. 
This Library was compiled with Arduino IDE with the "Blue Pill" board (STM32F103C8)
The interrupt pin level for 3.3V is not recognised by  Arduino uno or Nano board.
It can be either connected Through a transistor or an ATMEGA IC on 3.3v level.
